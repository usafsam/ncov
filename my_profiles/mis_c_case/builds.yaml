# This is where we define which builds we'd like to run.
# This example includes 4 separate builds, ranging from the regional (global) to location (county) level.
# You can comment-out, remove, or add as many builds as you'd like.

# Each build needs a name, a defined subsampling process, and geographic attributes used for subsampling.
# Geography is specified by build attributes (e.g., `region`, `country`, `division`, `location`) that are referenced from subsampling schemes.

# The default config file, `./defaults/parameters.yaml` has reasonable default subsampling methods for each geographic resolution.
# These subsample primarily from the area of interest ("focus"), and add in background ("contextual") sequences from the rest of the world.
# Contextual sequences that are genetically similar to (hamming distance) and geographically near the focal sequences are heavily prioritized.

# In this example, we use these default methods. See other templates for examples of how to customize this subsampling scheme.

builds:
  # Focus on King County (location) in Washington State (division) in the USA (country)
  # with a build name that will produce the following URL fragment on Nextstrain/auspice:
  # /ncov/north-america/usa/washington/king-county
  mis_c_case: # name of the build; this can be anything
    subsampling_scheme: mis_c_focus # use a custom subsampling scheme defined below
    region: North America
    country: USA
    division: Washington
    # Whatever your finest geographic scale is (here, 'location' since we are doing a county in the USA)
    # list 'up' from here the geographic area that location is in.
    # Here, King County is in Washington state, is in USA, is in North America.

# Define custom subsampling logic for focusing on mis_c_case.
subsampling:
  mis_c_focus:
    # Focal samples for division
    focal:
      group_by: "year month"
      seq_per_group: 1
      # Use augur filter's query argument to filter strains with pandas-style logic expressions.
      # This can be easier to read than the corresponding filter by exclusion.
      query: --query "(country == '{country}')"

    # Samples that are genetically related to the focal samples
    related:
      group_by: "region year"
      seq_per_group: 1
      # exclude: "--exclude-where 'division={division}'"
      priorities:
        type: "proximity"
        focus: "focal"

    # Contextual samples from the rest of the world
    contextual:
      group_by: "region year"
      seq_per_group: 1
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'division={division}'"

# Here, you can specify what type of auspice_config you want to use

# If you want to specify specific files for each build - you can!
